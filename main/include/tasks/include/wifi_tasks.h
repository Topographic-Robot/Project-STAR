 *
 * @return

 * - ESP_FAIL if the interface does not exist or no IP address is assigned.
 *

/**
 * @brief Initializes the WiFi in station mode and connects to the specified Access Point (AP).
 *
 * Sets up the ESP32's WiFi system to operate in station (STA) mode and attempts
 * to connect to a preconfigured Access Point (AP). The initialization process
 * includes setting up the required event handlers, configuring the network
 * interface, and managing the connection lifecycle. Upon successful connection,
 * the system acquires an IP address for further network operations.
 *
 * Steps performed:
 *   1. Creates an event group to manage WiFi events.
 *   2. Initializes the underlying TCP/IP stack.
 *   3. Creates the default event loop required for handling WiFi and IP events.
 *   4. Sets up the default WiFi station (STA) network interface.
 *   5. Initializes the WiFi driver with default configuration settings.
 *   6. Registers event handlers for WiFi and IP events.
 *   7. Configures the WiFi settings with the specified SSID, password, 
 *      authentication mode, and SAE settings if applicable.
 *   8. Sets the WiFi mode to station (STA) mode.
 *   9. Starts the WiFi driver.
 *   10. Waits for the WiFi connection to be established or logs an error on failure.
 *
 * @return 
 * - ESP_OK   if the WiFi is initialized and connected successfully.
 * - ESP_FAIL if any step in the initialization or connection process fails.
 *
 * @note 
 * - Ensure the SSID and password are correctly configured before calling this function.
 * - This function blocks until a connection is established or a failure occurs.
 * - Check the logs for detailed information about the connection status and errors.
