/**
 * @brief Records sensor data and stores it in a given variable.
 *
 * Continuously records data from all configured sensors and updates the provided
 * `sensor_data_t` structure with the latest readings. This function processes the
 * raw data from sensors and ensures it is ready for further use, such as uploading
 * to a server or storing in a database. The function relies on previously 
 * established sensor communication initialized by `sensors_init`.
 *
 * Pre-condition:
 * - The `sensors_init` function must have been successfully called and completed 
 *   to ensure communication with all sensors is established.
 *
 * Post-condition:
 * - The `sensor_data_t` structure is updated with the most recent sensor readings.
 * - The data is available for further processing or transmission.
 *
 * @param[in,out] sensor_data Pointer to the `sensor_data_t` struct where sensor 
 *                            readings will be stored and updated.
 *
 * @return 
 * - ESP_OK   if all sensor tasks are successfully started and run.
 * - ESP_FAIL if any sensor task fails during execution.
 *
 * @note This function should run continuously as part of the main sensor task loop 
 *       or be called periodically in a task for data acquisition.
