/**
 * @brief Enqueues a file write request.
 *
 * Adds a file write request to the queue for asynchronous processing. 
 * The data will be written to the specified file in the background by 
 * the file write task. If the file does not exist, it will be created 
 * automatically. All writes append data to the file. Each line written 
 * includes a timestamp at the beginning in the format `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`.
 *
 * @param[in] file_path Path to the file (e.g., "/sdcard/sensor1.txt"). 
 *                      This must be a valid file path accessible by 
 *                      the system.
 * @param[in] data      Null-terminated string to write to the file. The 
 *                      string should not exceed the maximum size allowed 
 *                      by the queue.
 *
 * @return
 * - ESP_OK              if the request was successfully enqueued.
 * - ESP_ERR_INVALID_ARG if any argument is invalid (e.g., NULL pointers).
 * - ESP_FAIL            if the queue is full.
 *
 * @note Ensure `file_write_manager_init` has been called before invoking 
 *       this function. The function does not block but returns immediately 
 *       after enqueueing the request.
