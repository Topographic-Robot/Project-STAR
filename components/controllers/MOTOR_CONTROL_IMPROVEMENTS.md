## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Consistent API**: Maintain a consistent API:
   - `motor_init()` - Initialize the motor system
   - `motor_move_to()` - Move motor to specified position
   - `motor_move_by()` - Move motor by relative amount
   - `motor_stop()` - Stop motor movement
   - `motor_emergency_stop()` - Emergency stop with controlled deceleration
   - `motor_get_position()` - Get current motor position
   - `motor_set_speed()` - Set motor movement speed
   - `motor_set_acceleration()` - Set motor acceleration profile
   - `motor_calibrate()` - Calibrate the motor
   - `motor_self_test()` - Perform self-test
   - `motor_sleep()` - Put motor in low-power mode
   - `motor_wake_up()` - Wake motor from low-power mode
   - `motor_reset()` - Reset the motor controller

2. **Motor Mapping**: Create efficient motor identification and mapping:
   - `motor_map_identify()` - Identify connected motors
   - `motor_map_configure()` - Configure motor parameters 
   - `motor_map_get_id()` - Get motor ID from function (hip/femur/tibia)
   - `motor_map_get_function()` - Get function from motor ID
