## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Consistent API**: Maintain a consistent API across all communication interfaces:
   - `xxx_init()` - Initialize the interface (xxx = i2c, uart, spi)
   - `xxx_deinit()` - Deinitialize the interface
   - `xxx_read()` - Read data from the interface
   - `xxx_write()` - Write data to the interface
   - `xxx_transfer()` - Combined read/write operation
   - `xxx_select_device()` - Select target device on shared bus
   - `xxx_scan_bus()` - Scan for connected devices
   - `xxx_reset_bus()` - Reset the communication bus
   - `xxx_self_test()` - Perform self-test

2. **Transaction Management**: Create robust transaction handling:
   - `xxx_transaction_create()` - Create a transaction descriptor
   - `xxx_transaction_submit()` - Submit transaction to queue
   - `xxx_transaction_wait()` - Wait for transaction completion
   - `xxx_transaction_cancel()` - Cancel pending transaction
   - `xxx_transaction_set_callback()` - Set completion callback
   - `xxx_transaction_set_timeout()` - Set transaction timeout

3. **Error Handling**: Use ESP-IDF error codes consistently:
   - Return `ESP_OK` for successful operations
   - Return appropriate error codes for specific failures
   - Map interface-specific errors to ESP-IDF codes
   - Log detailed error information
   - Implement bus-specific error recovery procedures

4. **Thread Safety**: Ensure all functions are thread-safe:
   - Use mutexes to protect shared resources
   - Implement critical section protection for bus access
   - Handle potential race conditions during device selection
   - Provide both blocking and non-blocking interfaces

5. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Implement DMA for data transfers when possible
   - Use consistent buffer management strategies
   - Optimize for both throughput and latency
   - Implement proper ISR handling with minimal overhead
