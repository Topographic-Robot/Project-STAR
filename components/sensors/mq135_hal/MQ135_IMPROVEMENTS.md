## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Consistent API**: Maintain a consistent API:
   - `mq135_init()` - Initialize the sensor
   - `mq135_read_raw()` - Read raw ADC value
   - `mq135_read_resistance()` - Read calculated sensor resistance
   - `mq135_read_ppm()` - Read calculated gas concentration in ppm
   - `mq135_read_co2()` - Read CO2 concentration
   - `mq135_read_nh3()` - Read NH3 concentration
   - `mq135_self_test()` - Perform self-test
   - `mq135_calibrate()` - Calibrate the sensor
   - `mq135_reset()` - Reset the sensor

2. **ADC Handling**: Create robust ADC reading functions:
   - `mq135_read_adc()` - Read ADC value with proper error handling
   - `mq135_convert_to_resistance()` - Convert ADC value to resistance
   - `mq135_convert_to_ratio()` - Convert resistance to Rs/R0 ratio
   - `mq135_convert_to_ppm()` - Convert ratio to ppm

3. **Error Handling**: Use ESP-IDF error codes consistently:
   - Return `ESP_OK` for successful operations
   - Return appropriate error codes for failures
   - Log detailed error information

4. **Thread Safety**: Ensure all functions are thread-safe:
   - Use mutexes to protect shared resources
   - Implement critical section protection where necessary

5. **Temperature and Humidity Compensation**:
   - Implement temperature and humidity correction factors
   - Adjust gas concentration based on environmental conditions
   - Document the compensation algorithms and coefficients
