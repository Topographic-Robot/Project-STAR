## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Consistent API**: Maintain a consistent API:
   - `qmc5883l_init()` - Initialize the sensor
   - `qmc5883l_read_mag()` - Read raw magnetic field data
   - `qmc5883l_read_heading()` - Read calculated heading
   - `qmc5883l_self_test()` - Perform self-test
   - `qmc5883l_calibrate()` - Calibrate the sensor
   - `qmc5883l_sleep()` - Put sensor in low-power mode
   - `qmc5883l_wake_up()` - Wake sensor from low-power mode
   - `qmc5883l_reset()` - Reset the sensor

2. **Register Access**: Create abstraction functions for register operations:
   - `qmc5883l_write_reg()` - Write to a register
   - `qmc5883l_read_reg()` - Read from a register
   - `qmc5883l_modify_reg()` - Modify specific bits in a register

3. **Error Handling**: Use ESP-IDF error codes consistently:
   - Return `ESP_OK` for successful operations
   - Return appropriate error codes for failures
   - Log detailed error information

4. **Thread Safety**: Ensure all functions are thread-safe:
   - Use mutexes to protect shared resources
   - Implement critical section protection for timing-sensitive operations

5. **Configuration**: Implement flexible configuration options:
   - Support all available output data rates
   - Support all available measurement ranges
   - Support all available oversampling options
