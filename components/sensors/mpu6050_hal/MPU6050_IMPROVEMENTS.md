## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Consistent API**: Maintain a consistent API:
   - `mpu6050_init()` - Initialize the sensor
   - `mpu6050_read_accel()` - Read accelerometer data
   - `mpu6050_read_gyro()` - Read gyroscope data
   - `mpu6050_read_temp()` - Read temperature data
   - `mpu6050_read_all()` - Read all sensor data
   - `mpu6050_self_test()` - Perform self-test
   - `mpu6050_calibrate()` - Calibrate the sensor
   - `mpu6050_sleep()` - Put sensor in low-power mode
   - `mpu6050_wake_up()` - Wake sensor from low-power mode
   - `mpu6050_reset()` - Reset the sensor

2. **Register Access**: Create abstraction functions for register operations:
   - `mpu6050_write_reg()` - Write to a register
   - `mpu6050_read_reg()` - Read from a register
   - `mpu6050_modify_reg()` - Modify specific bits in a register

3. **Error Handling**: Use ESP-IDF error codes consistently:
   - Return `ESP_OK` for successful operations
   - Return appropriate error codes for failures
   - Log detailed error information

4. **Thread Safety**: Ensure all functions are thread-safe:
   - Use mutexes to protect shared resources
   - Implement critical section protection for timing-sensitive operations
