# DHT22 Sensor Improvements

This document outlines the specific improvements that should be implemented for the DHT22 temperature and humidity sensor in the Project Star system.

## 1. Enhanced Error Handling and Recovery

- [ ] Implement robust error detection and recovery mechanism for timing-sensitive DHT22 protocol
- [ ] Add reset function that power cycles the DHT22 and reconfigures it
- [ ] Implement exponential backoff for retry attempts to avoid excessive resets
- [ ] Add tracking of consecutive errors and timeouts due to signal edge detection issues
- [ ] Implement automatic recovery from communication failures caused by electrical noise

## 2. Improved Data Processing

- [ ] Add moving average filter to reduce noise in temperature and humidity readings
- [ ] Implement validation of readings against expected ranges (0-100% humidity, -40°C to 80°C)
- [ ] Enhance data conversion process with better calibration for humidity compensation
- [ ] Add outlier detection and filtering for sudden temperature/humidity spikes
- [ ] Implement signal processing algorithms for more accurate readings in high humidity environments

## 3. Calibration System

- [ ] Create comprehensive calibration process that collects multiple temperature and humidity samples
- [ ] Add functions to save and load calibration values to/from NVS
- [ ] Implement automatic loading of calibration values during initialization
- [ ] Add user-triggered calibration routine with reference to known temperature/humidity values
- [ ] Implement periodic recalibration checks based on environmental stability

## 4. Power Management

- [ ] Add sleep and wake-up functions to save power during idle periods
- [ ] Implement automatic power management in the DHT22 task (1Hz sampling is standard)
- [ ] Add proper handling of sensor state during power transitions
- [ ] Implement power consumption monitoring
- [ ] Add low-power modes for battery operation with reduced sampling frequency

## 5. Sensor Health Monitoring

- [ ] Add tracking of consecutive errors and timeouts
- [ ] Implement watchdog mechanism to detect unresponsive sensor
- [ ] Add periodic logging of sensor health statistics
- [ ] Implement diagnostic routines for sensor troubleshooting
- [ ] Add temperature monitoring to detect overheating or freezing conditions

## 6. Self-Test Functionality

- [ ] Create comprehensive self-test function that verifies DHT22 functionality
- [ ] Add checks for sensor identity, communication timing, and data reading checksum verification
- [ ] Integrate self-test into the initialization process
- [ ] Implement periodic self-tests during operation
- [ ] Add detailed reporting of self-test results

## 7. Task Management

- [ ] Improve DHT22 task with better error handling and recovery
- [ ] Add tracking of successful readings and error rates
- [ ] Enhance interrupt handling with better timeout management for precise timing requirements
- [ ] Implement priority-based processing of sensor data
- [ ] Add task statistics collection for performance monitoring

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Consistent API**: Maintain a consistent API:
   - `dht22_init()` - Initialize the sensor
   - `dht22_read_temperature()` - Read temperature data
   - `dht22_read_humidity()` - Read humidity data
   - `dht22_read_data()` - Read both temperature and humidity
   - `dht22_self_test()` - Perform self-test
   - `dht22_calibrate()` - Calibrate the sensor
   - `dht22_reset()` - Reset the sensor

2. **Critical Section Protection**:
   - Implement critical section protection for timing-sensitive operations
   - Use portENTER_CRITICAL() and portEXIT_CRITICAL() around bit-banging operations

3. **Error Handling**: Use ESP-IDF error codes consistently
   - Handle checksum errors appropriately
   - Handle timeout errors during bit-banging operations
   - Log detailed error information

4. **Documentation**: Document all functions, parameters, and return values
   - Include timing requirements for communication protocol
