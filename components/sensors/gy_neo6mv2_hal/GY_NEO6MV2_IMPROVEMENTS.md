## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Consistent API**: Maintain a consistent API:
   - `gps_init()` - Initialize the GPS module
   - `gps_read_position()` - Read position data (latitude, longitude, altitude)
   - `gps_read_time()` - Read time data
   - `gps_read_speed()` - Read speed and course data
   - `gps_read_satellites()` - Read satellite information
   - `gps_self_test()` - Perform self-test
   - `gps_sleep()` - Put module in low-power mode
   - `gps_wake_up()` - Wake module from low-power mode
   - `gps_reset()` - Reset the module

2. **NMEA Parsing**: Create robust NMEA sentence parsing:
   - `gps_parse_nmea()` - Parse NMEA sentences
   - `gps_parse_gga()` - Parse GGA sentences (position fix)
   - `gps_parse_rmc()` - Parse RMC sentences (recommended minimum data)
   - `gps_parse_gsa()` - Parse GSA sentences (satellites active)
   - `gps_parse_gsv()` - Parse GSV sentences (satellites in view)
   - `gps_parse_vtg()` - Parse VTG sentences (course and speed)

3. **Error Handling**: Use ESP-IDF error codes consistently:
   - Return `ESP_OK` for successful operations
   - Return appropriate error codes for failures
   - Log detailed error information

4. **Thread Safety**: Ensure all functions are thread-safe:
   - Use mutexes to protect shared resources
   - Implement critical section protection where necessary

5. **Buffer Management**: Implement proper buffer handling:
   - Use ring buffers for UART reception
   - Implement checksums for data integrity
   - Handle buffer overflows gracefully
