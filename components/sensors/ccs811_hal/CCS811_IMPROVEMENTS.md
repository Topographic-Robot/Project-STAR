## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Consistent API**: Maintain a consistent API:
   - `ccs811_init()` - Initialize the sensor
   - `ccs811_read_eco2()` - Read eCO2 concentration
   - `ccs811_read_tvoc()` - Read TVOC concentration
   - `ccs811_read_raw()` - Read raw ADC values
   - `ccs811_set_mode()` - Set operating mode
   - `ccs811_set_environmental_data()` - Set temperature and humidity compensation
   - `ccs811_get_baseline()` - Get current baseline
   - `ccs811_set_baseline()` - Set baseline value
   - `ccs811_self_test()` - Perform self-test
   - `ccs811_sleep()` - Put sensor in low-power mode
   - `ccs811_wake_up()` - Wake sensor from low-power mode
   - `ccs811_reset()` - Reset the sensor

2. **Register Access**: Create abstraction functions for register operations:
   - `ccs811_write_reg()` - Write to a register
   - `ccs811_read_reg()` - Read from a register
   - `ccs811_write_app_data()` - Write application data
   - `ccs811_read_app_data()` - Read application data

3. **Error Handling**: Use ESP-IDF error codes consistently:
   - Return `ESP_OK` for successful operations
   - Return appropriate error codes for failures
   - Handle CCS811-specific error flags (ERROR_ID register)
   - Log detailed error information

4. **Thread Safety**: Ensure all functions are thread-safe:
   - Use mutexes to protect shared resources
   - Implement critical section protection where necessary

5. **Initialization Sequence**:
   - Implement proper boot sequence (reset, app start, mode setting)
   - Add verification of APP_VALID status
   - Handle HW_VERSION and FW_BOOT_VERSION checks
   - Verify successful transition to application mode
