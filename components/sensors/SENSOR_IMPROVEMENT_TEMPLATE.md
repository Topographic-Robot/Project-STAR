- [ ] Add tracking of successful readings and error rates
- [ ] Enhance interrupt handling with better timeout management
- [ ] Implement priority-based processing of sensor data
- [ ] Add task statistics collection for performance monitoring

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Consistent API**: Maintain a consistent API across all sensor components:
   - `sensor_init()` - Initialize the sensor
   - `sensor_read()` - Read data from the sensor
   - `sensor_self_test()` - Perform self-test
   - `sensor_calibrate()` - Calibrate the sensor
   - `sensor_sleep()` - Put sensor in low-power mode
   - `sensor_wake_up()` - Wake sensor from low-power mode
   - `sensor_reset()` - Reset the sensor

2. **Error Handling**: Use ESP-IDF error codes consistently:
   - Return `ESP_OK` for successful operations
   - Return appropriate error codes for failures
   - Log detailed error information

3. **Documentation**: Document all functions, parameters, and return values:
   - Use consistent comment style
   - Include usage examples
   - Document calibration procedures

4. **Thread Safety**: Ensure all functions are thread-safe:
   - Use mutexes to protect shared resources
   - Implement critical section protection for timing-sensitive operations

5. **Resource Management**: Properly manage resources:
   - Free allocated memory
   - Close open handles
   - Release hardware resources when not in use
