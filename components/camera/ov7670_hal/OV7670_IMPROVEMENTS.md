## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Consistent API**: Maintain a consistent API:
   - `ov7670_init()` - Initialize the camera
   - `ov7670_capture_frame()` - Capture a single frame
   - `ov7670_start_streaming()` - Start continuous capture
   - `ov7670_stop_streaming()` - Stop continuous capture
   - `ov7670_set_format()` - Set image format
   - `ov7670_set_resolution()` - Set image resolution
   - `ov7670_set_brightness()` - Adjust brightness
   - `ov7670_set_contrast()` - Adjust contrast
   - `ov7670_self_test()` - Perform self-test
   - `ov7670_sleep()` - Put camera in low-power mode
   - `ov7670_wake_up()` - Wake camera from low-power mode
   - `ov7670_reset()` - Reset the camera

2. **Register Access**: Create abstraction functions for register operations:
   - `ov7670_write_reg()` - Write to a register
   - `ov7670_read_reg()` - Read from a register
   - `ov7670_modify_reg()` - Modify specific bits in a register

3. **Frame Buffer Management**:
   - Create efficient buffer allocation and management
   - Implement double buffering for continuous capture
   - Add buffer queue for frame processing
   - Implement memory-efficient frame storage
   - Add buffer recycling mechanism

4. **Error Handling**: Use ESP-IDF error codes consistently:
   - Return `ESP_OK` for successful operations
   - Return appropriate error codes for failures
   - Log detailed error information

5. **Multi-Camera Support**:
   - Implement camera selection mechanism
   - Add support for different configurations per camera
   - Create synchronized multi-camera capture
   - Implement efficient resource sharing between cameras
