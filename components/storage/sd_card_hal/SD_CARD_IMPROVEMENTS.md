## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Consistent API**: Maintain a consistent API:
   - `sd_card_init()` - Initialize the SD card
   - `sd_card_deinit()` - Deinitialize the SD card
   - `sd_card_read()` - Read data from the card
   - `sd_card_write()` - Write data to the card
   - `sd_card_erase()` - Erase sectors on the card
   - `sd_card_get_info()` - Get card information
   - `sd_card_self_test()` - Perform self-test
   - `sd_card_check_presence()` - Check if card is present
   - `sd_card_mount_fs()` - Mount the filesystem
   - `sd_card_unmount_fs()` - Unmount the filesystem

2. **Filesystem Operations**: Create robust file operations:
   - `sd_file_open()` - Open a file with error handling
   - `sd_file_close()` - Close a file with proper flush
   - `sd_file_read()` - Read from a file with retries
   - `sd_file_write()` - Write to a file with journaling
   - `sd_file_sync()` - Synchronize file data to storage
   - `sd_dir_create()` - Create directory with parent creation
   - `sd_file_delete()` - Delete file with verification

3. **Error Handling**: Use ESP-IDF error codes consistently:
   - Return `ESP_OK` for successful operations
   - Return appropriate error codes for specific failures
   - Log detailed error information
   - Implement card-specific error mapping to ESP-IDF codes

4. **Thread Safety**: Ensure all functions are thread-safe:
   - Use mutexes to protect shared resources
   - Implement critical section protection where necessary
   - Handle potential race conditions during card insertion/removal

5. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Implement efficient buffer management
   - Use DMA for data transfers when possible
   - Optimize for both sequential and random access patterns
   - Implement read-ahead caching for sequential reads
