HARDWARE SELECTION DECISION TREE
This tool will help you select the optimal hardware for your project
================================================================================

What is your primary hardware requirement?
1. Full operating system (Linux) with high processing power
2. Custom digital logic and hardware parallelism
3. Microcontroller for embedded applications

Enter your choice (number): 3

What is your power constraint?

2. Low power (battery for days/weeks)
3. Standard power (regular charging or mains power)

Enter your choice (number): 3

Do you need wireless connectivity?
1. Yes, Wi-Fi and/or Bluetooth is essential
2. No, don't need wireless or will add external module

Enter your choice (number): 1

What level of analog interface do you need?
1. High-precision analog (14-bit+ ADC)

3. Basic/minimal analog
4. No analog needed

Enter your choice (number): 3

Do you need real-time processing capabilities?
1. Yes, hard real-time requirements
2. Soft real-time is sufficient
3. No real-time requirements

Enter your choice (number): 2

How important is development simplicity?
1. Very important (prefer high-level languages/frameworks)

3. Not important (willing to learn complex tools)

Enter your choice (number): 3

What's your processing requirement?
1. Very high (compute-intensive tasks, AI, etc.)
2. High (complex algorithms, graphics)
3. Medium (typical embedded applications)
4. Low (simple sensing, control tasks)

Enter your choice (number): 3
